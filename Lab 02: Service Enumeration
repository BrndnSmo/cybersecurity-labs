# Lab 02: Service Enumeration

## 🎯 Objective
Identify running services and their versions to assess potential vulnerabilities.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- nmap
- enum4linux
- nikto
- whatweb
- nuclei

## 🧠 Target Info
| Detail       | Value              |
|--------------|--------------------|
| Target IP    | 192.168.56.101     |
| Open Ports   | 21, 22, 80, 139, 445 |

## 🔍 Steps Taken
1. Ran `nmap -sV -A 192.168.56.101`
2. Ran `enum4linux 192.168.56.101` for SMB shares
3. Ran `nikto -h http://192.168.56.101` for web server scan
4. Ran `whatweb http://192.168.56.101` for tech fingerprinting
5. Ran `nuclei -u http://192.168.56.101` for CVE scan

## ✅ Outcome
- Discovered Apache 2.2.8, Samba 3.0.20, vsftpd 2.3.4
- Found potential vulnerabilities for exploitation
- Screenshots saved in `/screenshots/`

## 🧠 Reflection
- Enumeration is critical before exploitation
- Learned how to correlate service versions with known CVEs
- Next: Exploit vsftpd 2.3.4 in Lab 03
