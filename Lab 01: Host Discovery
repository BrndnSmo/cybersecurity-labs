# Lab 01: Host Discovery

## 🎯 Objective
Identify live hosts on the local network using passive and active scanning tools.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- netdiscover
- nmap
- arp-scan

## 🧠 Target Info
| Detail       | Value              |
|--------------|--------------------|
| Subnet       | 192.168.56.0/24    |
| Interface    | eth0               |

## 🔍 Steps Taken
1. Ran `netdiscover -r 192.168.56.0/24`
2. Ran `nmap -sn 192.168.56.0/24`
3. Ran `arp-scan --interface eth0 --localnet`
4. Saved output to `netdiscover.txt` and `nmap-sweep.txt`

## ✅ Outcome
- Found 3 live hosts
- Confirmed IPs and MAC addresses
- Screenshot saved in `/screenshots/`

## 🧠 Reflection
- Passive scans are stealthier but slower
- ARP scan was fastest and most accurate
- Next: Port scanning on discovered hosts
