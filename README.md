# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Labs: Hands-On Offensive Security

Welcome to my cybersecurity lab journal — a curated collection of hands-on exercises in ethical hacking, vulnerability assessment, and post-exploitation. These labs are part of my 10-week journey to become a cybersecurity analyst by January 2026.

## 🧰 Tools & Platforms
- Kali Linux, Metasploit Framework
- Nmap, Nikto, Enum4linux, Netcat, LinPEAS
- Custom Python tools via BlackBox GUI
- GitHub for documentation and version control

## 🧪 Lab Series
| Lab | Topic                        | Description |
|-----|------------------------------|-------------|
| 01  | Host Discovery               | Identify live hosts and open ports |
| 02  | Service Enumeration          | Fingerprint services and detect vulnerabilities |
| 03  | Exploitation                 | Use Metasploit and manual exploits to gain access |
